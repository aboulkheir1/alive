Media is the biggest propaganda and manufactoring consent tools.

Mainstream Media:
- Each media company has its own agenda and goals.
- Some do relatively honest reporting but that changes by time. Don't assume that will always be the case.
- Even BBC, the publicly funded news media seems very biased when it comes to Palestine/Israel war coverage.
- Always get information from multiple sources. Preferably, from sources on both sides so that you can have as much of a complete picture as possible.

TOOD: Add examples from Palestine/Israel vs Ukraine/Russia

Social Media:
- Social media broke control of mainstream media of the narrative.
- However, all social media is owned by private companies and get pressured to push certain agenda.
- All social media shadow ban Plastine content. Content is there but it won't be shown to users by limiting them from suggestions, not showing them in search results, or ranking them lower.

Independent Media:
- The current "solution" is called independent media.
- It's simply journalists and commentators who aren't funded by countries, companies, or wealthy individuals. They get most of their funding from normal people.

TODO: Add a list of indepenent media
